## What is this book about?
Every person and every organisation in the world manages data, whether they realise it or not. Data is used to describe the world around us and can be used for almost any purpose, from analysing consumer habits to fighting disease and serious organised crime.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Understand how Spark fits in the context of Big Data ecosystem
* Learn to deploy and configure local development environment using Apache Spark
* Lean to design Supervised and Unsupervised learning models
* Build models to perform NLP, Deep learning, cognitive services using Spark ML libraries
* Design real-time machine learning pipelines in Apache Spark
